C Matrix Toolkit

A dynamic matrix operations engine in C built using pointer-to-VLA allocation, recursive determinant evaluation, and modular function design.

This project demonstrates low-level memory control, runtime dimension handling, and clean procedural architecture beyond typical beginner implementations.
